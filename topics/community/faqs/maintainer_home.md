The **Maintainer Home** pages shows the state of the topic and its materials in terms of which available GTN features are being used, adherence to best practices, and when tutorials have last been updated, and which tutorials are the most used, etc. This can help inform where to focus your efforts.

You can find your **Maintainer Home** by
1. Opening the GTN **Topic** page of your choice
2. Scrolling down to the **Community Resources** section (below the list of tutorials)
3. Clicking the **Maintainer Home** button
