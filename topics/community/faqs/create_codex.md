The Galaxy Communities Dock or **Galaxy CoDex** is a centralized repository that ensures the versioning and documentation of the community components (Batut et al., 2024; NASR et al., 2025).
The codex is composed of 
  - A GitHub repository specific to each community with curated lists of tools, workflows and tutorials relevant to the community.
  For example : [The curated resources (tools, workflows, tutorials) for the microgalaxy codex](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/tree/main/communities/microgalaxy/resources).
  - The **Community lab**, a centralised webpage that enables communities to rapidly aggregate, curate, integrate, display, and launch relevant tools, workflows, and training on different Galaxy servers. This user-friendly interface, built on the Galaxy framework, provides community members with data analysis capacity without requiring programming expertise. Users can run individual tools or create complex workflows, with full provenance tracking to ensure reproducibility, designed specifically for the community research (NASR et al., 2025). 
  For example, [the microgalaxy lab (Europe)](https://microbiology.usegalaxy.eu/).
