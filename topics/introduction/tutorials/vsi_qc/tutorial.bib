  abstract  = {DNA sequence information underpins genetic research, enabling
               discoveries of important biological or medical benefit.
               Sequencing projects have traditionally used long (400-800 base
               pair) reads, but the existence of reference sequences for the
               human and many other genomes makes it possible to develop new,
               fast approaches to re-sequencing, whereby shorter reads are
               compared to a reference to identify intraspecies genetic
               variation. Here we report an approach that generates several
               billion bases of accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment at
               low cost. Single molecules of DNA are attached to a flat
               surface, amplified in situ and used as templates for synthetic
               sequencing with fluorescent reversible terminator
               deoxyribonucleotides. Images of the surface are analysed to
               generate high-quality sequence. We demonstrate application of
               this approach to human genome sequencing on flow-sorted X
               chromosomes and then scale the approach to determine the genome
               sequence of a male Yoruba from Ibadan, Nigeria. We build an
               accurate consensus sequence from >30x average depth of paired
               35-base reads. We characterize four million single-nucleotide
               polymorphisms and four hundred thousand structural variants,
               many of which were previously unknown. Our approach is effective
               for accurate, rapid and economical whole-genome re-sequencing
               and many other biomedical applications.},
