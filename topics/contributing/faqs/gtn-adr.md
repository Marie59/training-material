ADRs are documents that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

We keep track of some of our important Architecture decisions using a template based on
[Markdown Architectural Decision Record](https://adr.github.io/adr-templates/).

We feel that it is important to document these decisions to help future GTN maintainers understand the context and consequences of the decisions made in the past.

A number of our decisions were made with very explicit intentions, usually to prioritise contributors and ensure they have the best possible experience, maximising this over technical complexity and engineering efforts that are required to support it.

Most of our ADRs follow this pattern: Learners and Contributors come first, developers and deployers will be considered where possible.
