 come, kind death! and give me rest, yamba has no friend but thee; thou can'st ease my throbbing breast, thou can'st set the prisoner free.
 down my cheeks the tears are dripping, broken is my heart with grief; mangled my poor flesh with whipping, come kind death! and bring relief.
 what and if to death he send me, savage murder tho' it be, british law shall ne'er befriend me, they protect not slaves like me.
" mourning thus my wretched state, (ne'er may i forget the day) once in dusk of evening late, far from home i dar'd to stray; dar'd, alas! with impious haste tow'rds the roaring sea to fly; death itself i long'd to taste, long'd to cast me in and die.
 worn indeed with grief and pain, death i now will welcome in: o the heavenly prize to gain! o to 'scape the power of sin! true of heart, and meek and lowly, pure and blameless let me grow! holy may i be, for holy, is the place to which i go.
 but tho' death this hour may find me, still with afric's love i burn, (there i've left a spouse behind me) still to native land i turn.
 and when yamba sinks in death, this my latest prayer shall be, while i yield my parting breath, o that afric might be free.
