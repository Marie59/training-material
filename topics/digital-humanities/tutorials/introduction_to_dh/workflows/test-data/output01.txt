 come, kind death, and give me rest; yamba hath no friend but thee; thou canst ease my throbbing breast, thou canst set a pris'ner free.
 down my cheeks the tears are dripping; broken is my heart with grief, mangled is my flesh with whipping, come, kind death, and give relief.
 what! and if to death he send me, savage murder tho' it be; british laws will ne'er befriend me, they protect not slaves like me.
  dar'd, alas! with impious haste, toward the roaring sea to fly; death itself i long'd to taste, long'd to cast me in and die.
 but tho' death this hour i find, still with afric's love i burn; where i left a spouse behind, still to afric's land i turn.
 and when yamba sinks in death, this her latest pray'r may be; while she yields her parting breath, o! may afric's land be free.
