After preparing, training, and utilizing a language model for DNA sequences, we can now fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for specific DNA sequence classification tasks. Here, we will use a pre-trained model from Hugging Face, specifically the [Mistral-DNA-v1-17M-hg38](https://huggingface.co/RaphaelMourad/Mistral-DNA-v1-17M-hg38), and adapt it to classify DNA sequences based on their biological functions. Our objective is to classify sequences according to whether they bind to transcription factors.

> <comment-title>Transcription factors</comment-title>
>
> Transcription factors are proteins that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences, known as enhancers or promoters. These proteins act as molecular switches, turning genes on or off in response to various cellular signals and environmental cues. By binding to DNA, transcription factors either promote or inhibit the recruitment of RNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA, thereby influencing the rate of transcription.

The right panel, outlined in blue, shows a different DNA sequence 'GTGGCTAGTAGGTAG' labeled as 'DNA not binding CTCF,' indicating that this sequence does not interact with CTCF.](images/two_dna_sequences.png "Two types of DNA sequences. On the left, a DNA sequence that binds the transcription factor CTCF. On the right, a DNA sequence that does not bind CTCF.")

> Transcription factors are essential for numerous biological processes, including cell differentiation, development, and response to external stimuli. Their ability to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences allows them to orchestrate complex gene expression programs, ensuring that the right genes are expressed at the right time and in the right place within an organism. Understanding the function and regulation of transcription factors is vital for deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying health and disease, and it opens avenues for developing targeted therapeutic interventions.

This classification task is crucial for understanding gene regulation, as transcription factors play a vital role in controlling which genes are expressed in a cell. By training a model to predict whether a DNA sequence binds to a transcription factor, we can gain insights into regulatory mechanisms and potentially identify novel binding sites or understand the impact of genetic variations on transcription factor binding.

By fine-tuning the model, we aim to leverage its pre-trained knowledge of DNA sequences to achieve high accuracy in this classification task. This tutorial will guide you through the necessary steps, from data preparation to model evaluation, ensuring you can apply these techniques to your own research or projects.

We will use [`Mistral-DNA-v1-17M-hg38`](https://huggingface.co/RaphaelMourad/Mistral-DNA-v1-1M-hg38), a mixed model that was pre-trained on the entire Human Genome. It contains approximately 17 million parameters and was trained using the Human Genome assembly GRCh38 on sequences of 10,000 bases (10K):

```python
model_name="RaphaelMourad/Mistral-DNA-v1-17M-hg38"
```

# Configure fine-tuning

## Check and configure available resources

We select the appropriate device (CUDA-enabled GPU if available) for running PyTorch operations

```python
torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
```

Let's check the GPU usage and RAM:

```python
!nvidia-smi
```

We now set an environment variable that configures how PyTorch manages CUDA memory allocations

```python
os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "max_split_size_mb:32"
```

## Specify settings for quantization

Quantization is a technique used in machine learning and signal processing to reduce the precision of numerical values, typically to decrease memory usage and computational requirements. This process is particularly useful when working with large models as it allows them to be deployed on hardware with limited resources without significantly sacrificing performance.

Here, we use `BitsAndBytesConfig` to configure a 4-bit quantization. Using 4-bit precision reduces the memory footprint of the model, which is particularly useful for very large models that might not fit into GPU memory otherwise:

```python
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)
```

Using bfloat16 can provide a good balance between computational efficiency and numerical stability, especially on hardware that supports this format, such as certain GPUs and TPUs.

## Configure Accelerate

Now, we will configure the [Hugging Face Accelerate library](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index) to optimize the training process for large models using Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). This setup is crucial for efficiently utilizing GPU resources and enabling distributed training across multiple devices.

First, we need to configure the FSDP plugin, which will manage how model parameters and optimizer states are sharded across GPUs. This configuration helps in reducing memory usage and allows for the training of larger models.

```python
fsdp_plugin = FullyShardedDataParallelPlugin(
    state_dict_config=FullStateDictConfig(offload_to_cpu=True, rank0_only=False),
    optim_state_dict_config=FullOptimStateDictConfig(offload_to_cpu=True, rank0_only=False),
)
```
> <question-title></question-title>

{: .question}

Next, we initialize the Accelerator from the Hugging Face Accelerate library, integrating the FSDP plugin for seamless distributed training:

```python
accelerator = Accelerator(fsdp_plugin=fsdp_plugin)
```

By passing the FSDP plugin to the `Accelerator`, we enable sharded data parallelism, which efficiently manages model and optimizer states across multiple GPUs.

With this configuration, the `Accelerator` will handle the complexities of distributed training, allowing us to focus on developing and experimenting with our models. This setup is particularly beneficial when working with large-scale models and limited GPU resources, as it optimizes memory usage and enables faster training times.

## Configure LoRA for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

We will configure the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) settings for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of a large language model. LoRA is a technique that allows us to fine-tune only a small number of additional parameters while keeping the original model weights frozen, making it highly efficient for adapting large models to specific tasks.

We use the `LoraConfig` class to define the settings for LoRA. This configuration specifies how the low-rank adaptations are applied to the model.

```python
peft_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=16,
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="SEQ_CLS",
    target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj", "gate_proj"]
)
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>

{: .question}

By configuring LoRA in this way, we can efficiently adapt a large pretrained model to a specific task with minimal computational overhead, making it feasible to fine-tune on consumer-grade hardware. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, or any other application where we need to specialize a general-purpose language model.

## Configure Training Arguments

Let's now set up the training arguments using the `TrainingArguments` class from the Hugging Face Transformers library. These arguments define the training configuration, including hyperparameters and settings for saving and evaluating the model.

```python
training_args = transformers.TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=1e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    bf16=True,
    report_to="none",
    load_best_model_at_end = True,
)
```

{: .question}

These settings provide a balanced configuration for training a model efficiently while ensuring that the best version of the model is saved and can be used for further evaluation or deployment. Adjust these parameters based on your specific use case and available computational resources.



# Prepare the tokenizer

We will now set up the tokenizer to convert DNA sequences into numerical tokens that the model can process. The tokenizer is a crucial component in preparing the data for model training and inference: it transforms raw text into a format that can be processed by machine learning models. 

We use the `AutoTokenizer` class from the Hugging Face Transformers library to load a pre-trained tokenizer. We specify the pre-trained model from which to load the tokenizer. This should match the model you plan to use for training or inference. This tokenizer will be configured to handle DNA sequences efficiently.

```python
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    model_max_length=200,
    padding_side="right",
    use_fast=True,
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
```

> <question-title></question-title>

>
{: .question}

By configuring the tokenizer in this way, we ensure that our DNA sequences are properly tokenized and formatted for input into the model. This step is essential for preparing our data for efficient and effective model training and evaluation.

Let's now tailor the tokenizer to better suit our specific use case, ensuring that the model processes sequences accurately and efficiently. Special tokens play a crucial role in defining how sequences are processed and interpreted by the model. Here, we sets:
- the end-of-sequence (EOS) token, which indicates the end of a sequence. It is essential for tasks where the model needs to generate sequences or understand where a sequence ends.
- the padding (PAD) token, which is used to pad sequences to a uniform length within a batch. Padding ensures that all sequences in a batch have the same length, which is necessary for efficient processing during training and inference

```
tokenizer.eos_token = "[EOS]"
tokenizer.pad_token = "[PAD]"
```

# Prepare data

To finetune the model, we must provide a dataset to train the model. We will the data with the 1st transcription factor (`tf0`) in mouse from {% cite zhou2024dnabert2efficientfoundationmodel %}. The data is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/raphaelmourad/Mistral-DNA).

## Get data

Let's get the data for from GitHub:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/raphaelmourad/Mistral-DNA.git
```

We now need to uncompress the labeled data:

```python
!tar -xf Mistral-DNA/data/GUE.tar.xz -C Mistral-DNA/data/
```

We change the current working directory to the `Mistral-DNA` folder.

```python
os.chdir("Mistral-DNA/")
print(os.getcwd())
```

Let's define experience and path to data variables

```python
expe = "tf/0"
data_path = f"data/GUE/{ expe }" 
```




## Prepare Datasets for Training and Validation

We now need to set up the datasets required for training and validating. Properly preparing these datasets is crucial for ensuring that the model finetunes effectively and generalizes well to new data.

We will use the files `data_path` folder we just defined:
- `train.csv` for training
- `dev.csv` for validation

> <question-title></question-title>

{: .question}


Before we proceed we import some classes and functions from `scriptPython/function.py`:

```python
### LOAD FUNCTIONS MODULE
import sys
sys.path.append("scriptPython/")
from functions import *
```

We use the `SupervisedDataset` class to load and prepare the datasets. This class handles the tokenization and formatting of the data, making it ready for model training and evaluation.

```python
train_dataset = SupervisedDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_path=Path(data_path) / "train.csv",
    kmer=-1,
)
val_dataset = SupervisedDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_path=Path(data_path) / "dev.csv",
    kmer=-1,
)
```

> <question-title></question-title>
>
> What does `kmer=-1`?
>
> > <solution-title></solution-title>

> {: .solution}
>
{: .question}

## Configure Data Collation

A data collator ensures that sequences are properly padded and formatted, which is crucial for optimizing the training process.

We'll use the `DataCollatorForSupervisedDataset` class to handle the collation of tokenized data. This collator will manage padding and ensure that all sequences in a batch are of uniform length.

```python
data_collator = DataCollatorForSupervisedDataset(tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

# Load and Configure the Model for Sequence Classification

Let's now load the pre-trained model, a model originally trained for large language modeling tasks, not specifically for classification. To adapt it for our binary classification task, we will add a new classification head on top of the existing architecture. This head will consist of a single neuron that connects to the output of the language model, enabling it to classify whether a DNA sequence binds to a transcription factor (label `1`) or not (label `0`).

This additional layer, or **classification head**, is a simple neural network layer that takes the high-level features extracted by the language model and maps them to our binary classification output. It learns to weigh these features appropriately to make accurate predictions for our specific task.

We use the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` class from the Hugging Face Transformers library to load the pre-trained model and set it up for our specific classification task:

```python
model=transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    num_labels=2,
    output_hidden_states=False,
    quantization_config=bnb_config,
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
```

To ensure that the model correctly handles padding tokens, we need to align the padding token configuration between the model and the tokenizer. This step is crucial for maintaining consistency during training and inference, especially when dealing with sequences of varying lengths:

```python
model.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id

# Initialize the Trainer

We can now set up the `Trainer` to manage the training and evaluation process of our model. The `Trainer` class simplifies the training loop, handling many of the complexities involved in training deep learning models.

We first need to attach the LoRA adapter to the model:

```python
model.add_adapter(peft_config, adapter_name="lora_1")
```

Let's now set up the `Trainer`:

```python
trainer = transformers.Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    callbacks = [EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience=3)]
)
```

> > 
> > How Early Stopping Works?
> > 
> > **Purpose**: The primary goal of early stopping is to capture the model parameters when the loss reaches its minimum value during training. This is crucial because, after a certain point, continued training may lead to overfitting, where the model starts to perform worse on unseen data.
> > 
> > **Patience Parameter**: The `early_stopping_patience=3` setting specifies that training should continue for three additional epochs after the model's performance on the validation set stops improving. This "patience" period helps mitigate the effects of noise in the training process. Noise can cause temporary fluctuations in the loss, making it seem like the model has reached a local minimum when further training might yield better results.
> >
> > **Process**: During training, the loss is monitored at each epoch. If the loss does not decrease for three consecutive epochs, training is stopped. However, if a better model with a lower loss is found within those three epochs, training continues. This approach ensures that the model has truly reached a robust local minimum, rather than being prematurely halted due to noise.

Ffor distributed training, where multiple GPUs or nodes are used to accelerate the training process, it is essential to do:

```python
trainer.local_rank=training_args.local_rank
```

The `local_rank` parameter identifies the rank of the current process within its local node, enabling coordinated communication and synchronization between processes. This setup is crucial for managing tasks such as gradient synchronization and data partitioning, ensuring that each process operates on the correct portion of the model or dataset. By assigning the local rank from `training_args` to the `Trainer`, we facilitate efficient and scalable training, leveraging the full computational power of multi-GPU environments.

# Start the training

Let's start the training process for our model using the trainer.train() method:

```python
trainer.train()
```

After launching `trainer.train()`, we can notice that the training process is significantly faster compared to training a model from scratch seen in ["" tutorial]({% link topics/statistics/tutorials/genomic-llm-pretraining/tutorial.md %}). This efficiency is due to the use of a pre-trained model, which has already undergone extensive training on large datasets using powerful computational resources. For example, pre-training a model on even a small portion of the human genome can take dozens of hours, but fine-tuning this model on a specific task, such as classifying DNA sequences, is much quicker. Fine-tuning leverages the pre-trained model's foundational knowledge, allowing you to adapt it to new tasks with a smaller, labeled dataset. This approach not only saves time but also reduces the need for extensive computational power. By downloading a pre-trained model from platforms like Hugging Face and fine-tuning it on a local machine with a modest GPU, we can achieve high performance with minimal overhead, making advanced modeling techniques accessible for a wide range of applications.

# Evaluate Model Performance

After successfully training the model, the next essential step is to evaluate its performance on a test dataset. This evaluation process is crucial for understanding how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data and for assessing its readiness for real-world applications.

The test data is stored in `data_path/test.csv`, we prepare it as for training and validation data.

```python
test_dataset = SupervisedDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_path=Path(data_path) / "test.csv",
    kmer=-1,
)
```

We then use the `trainer.evaluate()` method. This methods is designed to assess the model's performance on a specified dataset, typically the test dataset, which contains data that the model has not encountered during training.

```python
results = trainer.evaluate(eval_dataset=test_dataset)
```

The method computes various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, depending on the task and the configuration specified in `compute_metrics`. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

The Trainer uses the `data_collator` to ensure that the test data is properly formatted and padded, maintaining consistency with the training process. This consistency is crucial for accurate evaluation.

The evaluation results are stored in the `results` variable, which contains the computed metrics. We can analyze these `results` to gain insights into the model's performance and make informed decisions about further improvements or deployment.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored the process of fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) for DNA sequence classification. By following the steps outlined, you have learned how to leverage pre-trained models to achieve efficient and effective classification of DNA sequences, specifically focusing on their binding affinity to transcription factors.

We began by configuring the fine-tuning process, ensuring that available computational resources were optimally utilized. This included specifying settings for quantization, configuring Accelerate for distributed training, and implementing LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. These steps were crucial for maximizing performance and minimizing computational overhead.

Next, we prepared the tokenizer and data, ensuring that DNA sequences were properly tokenized and formatted for model input. We created datasets for training and validation, and configured data collation to handle batch processing efficiently.

We then loaded and configured the model for sequence classification, adding a classification head to adapt the pre-trained model to our specific task. With the model and data prepared, we initialized the `Trainer`, which streamlined the training process by managing the training loop, evaluation, and checkpointing.
