### Genome assembly


.left[
Goal: Reconstruct the sequences of a complete genome, or as close as possible to the complete genome, from sequences of DNA fragments (the "reads").
<br><br>
Genome assembly consists of aligning and reconstructing these fragments to form a continuous sequence (that of the chromosomes) or a set of contiguous sequences (called contigs or scaffolds).

### Steps before starting a genome project

.left[
- **Step 1**: Gather information about the target species : location, overlap with Indigenous People or local communities territories, expected genome size, ploidy, micro-chromosomes, organelles, etc.
What type of data is already available (reference gneomes, raw data, etc) : INSDC (ENA, NCBI, DBNJ)
<br><br>
- **Step 2**: If appropriate (depending on species and sampling location), engage with local communities, Indigenous people and/or local scientists who may have Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) associated to the species.
Obtain appropriate consent and permits (Nagoya protocol) before sampling.
<br><br>
- **Step 3**: Build a broad community of collaborators for the project, if possible.
<br><br>
- **Step 4**: Select the best possible DNA source and an optimal extraction procedure - **Sampling is THE key step**
<br><br>
- **Step 5**: Choose an appropriate sequencing technology
<br><br>
- **Step 6**: Sequence and assemble!

### Genome information: Heterozygosity level & Others

.pull-left[
.left[
**Heterozygous:** Locus-specific,  diploid (2N) organism has two different alleles of a particular gene at the same locus

<br>
**Heterozygosity** is a metric used to indicate the probability that an individual is heterozygous for a particular allele

- **Karyotype:** chromosome number
<br>
- **Sex chromosome system:** None, XY, ZW, UV,â€¦
<br>
- **Purity:** possible presence of contaminants and/or symbionts?
<br>
- Is there any other **useful data (NCBI, SRA, ENA, etc)** that could improve my assembly?

### DNA extraction tips

.left[
- Many **DNA extraction protocol** are available for a wide range of species/taxa (VGP, Darwin Tree of Life, Nanopore, PacBio, etc)
<br><br>
- **Keep DNA samples** from the same individual in case of library preparation or sequencing failure, need more coverage, new sequencing technology, etc
<br><br>
- Use a **single individual** and sequence a **haploid, a highly inbred diploid** organism, or an **isogenic** individual

]

.left[
**Contig**: a contiguous sequence in an assembly. A contig does not contain long stretches of unknown sequences (aka assembly **gaps**).
The contig is usually generated using the long-reads data.
<br>
**Scaffold**: a sequence consists of one or multiple contigs connected by assembly gaps of typically inexact sizes. A scaffold is also called a **supercontig**, though this terminology is rarely used nowadays.
Usually, scaffolds are generated using the Hi-C data
<br>
**Assembly**: a set of contigs or scaffolds.

### Assembly - Scaffolding (and manual curation)

.left[
Hi-C: Capturing interactions between different parts of a genome by measuring the physical proximity of DNA segments in the nucleus:
<br>
Binding of closely interacting DNA regions.
<br>
DNA is digested, labeled, and joined using ligations to create hybrid fragments.
<br>
These fragments are sequenced to reveal which parts of the genome were spatially close, even if they are distant in terms of linear sequence.
<br><br>
Hi-C allows for the transition from the assembly of fragmented contigs to:
- a high-quality assembly, with scaffolds
- a whole chromosome assembly

### Sequencing steps - The options

.left[
This mainly **depends on the quantity and quality of DNA as well as the cost of the experiment** but many parameters need to be considered before performing an NGS experiment:

- Short **versus** long reads or **both**
- Read length
- Read quality/error rate
- Genome read coverage/depth : Number of unique reads that include a given nucleotide in the reconstructed sequence.
    -30X coverage mean that, on average, each nucleotide in the genome is covered bu 30 reads.
    - Coverage = (read count * read length ) / total genome size
- Library preparation
- Available technology
- Downstream applications
]


---

### Sequencing steps - The technologies

.left[
Sequencing technology for **assembly**:
- **PacBio Hifi**: long reads (up to 20kb)
- **Nanopore**: long reads and ultra-long read (up to 100kb)
- **Illumina or MGI**: short reads (up to 2x250bp) with high quality reads. Sequencing bias with AT/GC rich regions

------

Sequencing technology for **scaffolding**:
- **Hi-C:** **restriction enzyme fragmentation** (single, multiples sites or DNAse). Need huge amount of coverage.
Providers : Arima Genomics, Phase Genomics, Dovetail Genomics
- Optical mapping: technique to physically locate specific enzymes restriction sites or sequence motifs to produce DNA sequence fingerprints.
Providers : BioNano, BGI

- Mate pair (deprecated)
- BAC/YAC/Fosmids (deprecated)

------

Typical sequencing strategies - EBP (Earth Biogenome Project) recommendation -
- Long-reads (PacBio HiFi or ONT) : 15x per haplotype
- Hi-C data (Arima / Illumina)
Polishing is no longer necessary or recommended

### Bioinformatics steps - Assembly quality

.left[
Different level of assembly exist today :
<br>
- **Contig Assembly**
<br>
- **Scaffold assembly**
<br>
- **Chromosome-level assembly** : When the number of scaffolds is the number of expected chromosomes, it means that 1 chromosome = 1 scaffold, and no large string of sequence is unlocated.

It can still contain gaps in between the scaffolds (shown as "NNNNNNNN" in the assembly)
<br>
- **T2T (Telomere-to-Telomere)** : Assembly without any gap (a chromosome level assembly without "NNNNN" sequences) 
]

---

### Bioinformatics steps - Definitions

.left[
**Haplotig**: a contig that comes from the same haplotype. In an unphased assembly, a contig may join alleles from different parental haplotypes in a diploid or polyploid genome.
<br>
**Primary assembly**: a complete assembly with long stretches of phased blocks.
<br>
**Alternate assembly**: an incomplete assembly consisting of haplotigs in heterozygous regions. An alternate assembly always accompanies a primary assembly. It is not useful by itself as it is fragmented and incomplete.
<br>
**Haplotype-resolved assembly**: sets of complete assemblies consisting of haplotigs, representing an entire diploid/polyploid genome.

### Computational resources and requirements

.left[
To be successful, you must have **sufficient computing resources (CPUS, RAM, walltime and storage)**.
- The resources needed are **different** for each step:
  - Assembly
  - Annotation
  - Other analysis tools
  <br>
- For genome **assembly:**
  - Running times and RAM increase with data **type** and **amount**
  - More data for large genomes, increase **runtime/RAM/Storage**
  - Most of tools **run** on a **single node**: they are parallelized but not distributed
  <br>
- For genome **annotation:**
  - Mapping/alignment of external data (RNA-seq, proteins) can be parallelized and distributed
  - Annotation process can be parallelized and distributed

### Bioinformatics data formats

### Continuity : N50

.left[
**N50**: given a set of sequences of varying lengths, the N50 is defined as **the length L of the shortest contig** for which **longer and equal length contigs cover at least 50% of the assembly**.
<br>
**L50**: given a set of sequences of varying lengths, the L50 is defined as **count of smallest number of sequences** whose **length sum makes up 50% of the assembly**.
<br>
**N50 describes a sequence length whereas L50 describes a number of sequences.**

Example:
- Genome size = 100
- Sequence sorted by size list L = (25, 10, 10, 8 , 7, 7 , 6 , 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2 ) = 100
- 50% of the total length is contained within sequences of at least 8bp: 25 + 10 + 10 + 8 â‰¥ 50
]

.image-100[
  ![Schematic explanation of N50](../../images/genome-qc/N50.png)

**N50 = 8** and **L50 = 4**

### Assembly QC Tips

- The quality of an assembly is often validated by using other data from the same individual or from other individuals (RNA-Seq alignment, Hi-C alignment, DNA-Seq alignment,...).

- The positions of the telomeric repeats in the chromosome assemblies are also of interesting to evaluate the correctness.

- The identification of organelles (mitochondria, chloroplast,...) can also inform us about the quality of the assembly in terms of completness. However, the structure of the organelles may lead the assembler to think that they are repeats and he discards them.

- In the case of diploid organisms, one of the classical problems of assemblies is the conservation of the two haplotypes. We obtains particular BUSCO / kmer / assembly size metrics that can be corrected by removing, "purging", the haplotigs.
