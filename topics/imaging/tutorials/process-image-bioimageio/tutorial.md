Deep learning models are increasingly used in bioimage analysis to perform processing steps such as segmentation, classification, and restoration tasks (e.g., {% cite Moen2019 %}). The [BioImage Model Zoo, (BioImage.IO)](https://bioimage.io/#/)({% cite Wei2021 %}) is a repository that provides access to pre-trained AI models, sharing a common metadata model that allows their reuse in different tools and platforms.

Each model in BioImage.IO is tailored for a specific biological task — for example, segmenting nuclei, detecting mitochondria, or identifying neuronal structures — and trained on specific imaging modalities such as electron or fluorescence microscopy (e.g., {% cite vonChamier2021 %}, {% cite GomezdeMariscal2021 %}).

This tutorial will guide you through the process of applying one of these BioImage.IO models to an input image using Galaxy ({% cite Batut2024 %}). You will learn how to upload and configure the model, set the correct input parameters, and interpret the output files.

# Example: Segmentation

Here we illustrate the type of information that is both useful for understanding the model's biological context and necessary for using the Galaxy tool — specifically, the input axes and input size parameters.

As an example, we consider the following model: **🧬 NucleiSegmentationBoundaryModel**

This model segments nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images. It predicts *boundary maps* and *foreground probabilities* for nucleus segmentation, primarily in images stained with DAPI. The outputs are designed to be post-processed with methods such as Multicut or Watershed to achieve instance-level segmentation (object-based segmentation).

- **Imaging modality**: Fluorescence microscopy
- **Task**: Nucleus segmentation (boundary-aware)
- **Model link**: [View on BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/#/r/ilastik/stardist_dsb_training_data)
- **Citation**: [10.5281/zenodo.5764893](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5764893)

The model will process the input image and generate two outputs:
- Two predicted images (written in one TIFF file)
- A predicted tensor matrix (`.npy`)

[Figure 1](#figure-1) below is a visualization of the two predicted images generated by the **🧬 NucleiSegmentationBoundaryModel**. Predicted Image 1 are the *foreground probabilities* and Predicted Image 2 are the *boundary map*.

## Post-processing of the model output

There are two challenges when it comes to using the model output for subsequent analysis. First, the model produces a single output file with two images (boundary maps and foreground probabilities), so for subsequent analysis we need to extract the corresponding information from that file. Second, neither of the two images produced by the model directly corresponds to segmentation results. Albeit the extracted image (Predicted Image 1) looks like a binary image with intensity 0 for the image background and intensity 1 for the image foreground, it is not. For example, there are fine contours of intensity values subtly below 1 between closely clustered cell nuclei. Thus, to obtain segmentation results, we first need to threshold the foreground probabilities (values ranging between 0 and 1) to determine the image foreground (as a binary image without any values between 0 and 1).

However, directly thresholding the foreground probabilities is going to lose information when it comes to closely clustered cell nuclei, where the crucial information is stored in the boundary map. To cope with that, we will extract both images (the *foreground probabilities* and the *boundary map*) from the output file, combine their information into a single image, and then perform thresholding.

>    > > Each pixel of the `foreground` image (Predicted Image 1) corresponds to the probability of that pixel being part of a foreground object. We have also seen that the `boundaries` image (Predicted Image 2) uses white (intensity value 1) to encode pixels which likely correspond to boundaries of cell nuclei, and lower intensity values for others. Thus, we can interpret the `boundaries` image as *boundary probabilities*, in the sense that each pixel of that image corresponds to the probability of that pixel being part of an object boundary (i.e. the boundary of a nucleus). By considering the expression `foreground - boundaries`, we essentially consider the probability of each pixel being part of the image foreground, *plus* the probability of that point being *not* part of an object boundary.

>    > > Thus, in the resulting image, the intensity of each pixel pixel can be interpreted as the probability of that pixel being part of the *interior* of a foreground object. This better preserves information about the individual cell nuclei in the image, which is especially crucial for closely clustered cell nuclei, as opposed to considering the *foregorund probabilities* solely.

Naturally, we would choose `0.5` to determine the image regions for which the probability is higher than 50% that the image pixels correspond to the interior of foreground objects (cell nuclei), but to improve the separation of closely clustered cell nuclei, it is a good practice to choose a threshold that is somewhat higher.

# Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to run a BioImage.IO model on a biological image using Galaxy. By uploading a compatible model and image, setting the appropriate size and axes, and running the tool, you obtained both a predicted image and a tensor matrix representing the model output.

This provides a fast, reproducible way to apply deep learning models in the context of bioimage analysis — all within Galaxy.
