title: Creation of a Community codex (and optionnally of a Special Interest Group (SIG))
description: |
  This learning pathway will take you through the creation of a community codex, and the generation of three tables to include in your community codex page : A tool table, a tutorial table and a workflow table (Module 1).
  It is also possible to create a Special Interest Group (SIG) page. SIG refers to a dedicated scientific community that crosses individual lab boundaries and wants to collaborate, share resources, support each other, and/or collectively advocate on a given theme (Module 2).

pathway:
  - section: "Module 1: Create a Galaxy Codex for your community"
    description: |
      The aim is this learning pathway is to create a Galaxy codex for your community.
      With the first tutorial, you will create the folder that will allow the creation of the community codex. Then, with the second tutorial, you will create an interactive table with all tools and their metadata in your community codex page. Tutorial 3 will create a tutorial table and tutorial 4 will create a workflow table.
      It is essential to start with the first tutorial (Creation of the codex folder), but then tutorial 2, 3 and 4 are independant and can be done in any order (or skipped altogether).
