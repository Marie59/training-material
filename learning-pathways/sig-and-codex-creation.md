title: Creation of a Community CoDex and lab (and optionally of a Special Interest Group (SIG))
type: instructors
description: |
  The Galaxy Communities Dock or **Galaxy CoDex** is a centralized repository that ensures the versioning and documentation of the community components (Batut et al., 2024; Nasr et al., 2024).

  The codex is composed of :
  - A **GitHub repository** specific to each community with curated lists of tools, workflows and tutorials relevant to the community.
  *For example : [The curated resources (tools, workflows, tutorials) for the microgalaxy codex](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy_codex/tree/main/communities/microgalaxy/resources).*

  - The **Community lab**, a centralised webpage that enables communities to rapidly aggregate, curate, integrate, display, and launch relevant tools, workflows, and training on different Galaxy servers. This user-friendly interface, built on the Galaxy framework, provides community members with data analysis capacity without requiring programming expertise. Users can run individual tools or create complex workflows, with full provenance tracking to ensure reproducibility, designed specifically for the community research (Nasr et al., 2024).
  *For example, [the microgalaxy lab (Europe)](https://microbiology.usegalaxy.eu/).*

  The **Special Interest Group (SIG)** refers to a dedicated scientific community that crosses individual lab boundaries and wants to collaborate, share resources, support each other, and/or collectively advocate on a given theme. We have SIGs based on region, domain of science, and more. You might consider that a SIG covers any group of like-minded Galaxy enthusiasts not currently combined into a Working Group.
  Here is the list of [currently existing SIGs](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/) and the [microgalaxy community of practice webpage](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/microbial#microgalaxy-community)

  **Description of the learning pathway:**
  - Module 1 : The creation of a community CoDex (including the lab interface). Generation of the CoDex includes the generation of three tables : A tool table, a tutorial table and a workflow table.
  - Module 2: Creation a Special Interest Group (SIG) page (optional).

  - section: "Module 1: Create a Galaxy CoDex for your community"
    description: |
      The aim is this learning pathway is to create a Galaxy CoDex for your community (including the lab interface).
      This module is composed of four tutorials :
        - Tutorial 1 : Creation of resources listing all the tools and their metadata relevant to your community.
        - Tutorial 2 : Creation of resources listing all the tutorials and their metadata relevant to your community.
        - Tutorial 3 : Creation of resources listing all the workflows and their metadata relevant to your community.
        - Tutorial 4 : Creation of the lab interface (in development)

      Tutorials 1, 2 and 3 are stand alones one and they can be done in any order (or skipped altogether).
      Tutorial 4 requires files generated by tutorials 1, 2 and 3 so should be done last.
