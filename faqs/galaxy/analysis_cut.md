The section below uses **Cut** tool. There are two **cut** tools in Galaxy due to historical reasons. This example uses tool with the full name {% tool [Cut columns from a table](Cut1) %}. However, the same logic applies to the other tool called {% tool [Advanced Cut](toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/text_processing/tp_cut_tool/9.5+galaxy0) %}. It simply has a slightly different interface.
