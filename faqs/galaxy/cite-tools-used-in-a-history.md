If you performed your data analysis in Galaxy, you can easily export a list of all the tools you used—and should cite—as follows:

1. Click on the **History options** button ( {% icon galaxy-history-options %} ) in the right-hand panel.
2. Select **Export Tool Citations** from the menu.
3. The middle panel will display a list of tools used in your history, with citation information provided in two formats: **APA** and **BibTeX**.
4. Don't forget to also cite [Galaxy itself](https://galaxyproject.org/citing-galaxy/) in your publication.

Proper citation helps support the developers and ensures reproducibility—thank you for taking this step!
