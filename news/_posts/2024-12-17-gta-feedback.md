# Give us feedback and your availability for the GTA 2025

As the end of the year is approaching rapidly, we are excited to announce:

ðŸŽ‰We have decided to host the next Galaxy Training Academy in Spring 2025!ðŸŽ‰

The GTA is only possible through community effort, and we will need all of you again to help make the GTA a success. Therefore, we are asking you to fill out this [Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_DVEdf7n9MWJe7XLa3UTPGMNE9y-F8S-EHXRrZ-twNETYrg/viewform) by the 20th of December. Here, you can provide feedback on what to improve, your availability for potential GTA weeks, and how you would like to contribute.
