# We want you to help us organize the Galaxy Training Academy 2026

🎉 We are excited to announce that we have started planning the **Galaxy Training Academy (GTA) 2026!** 🎉

As in previous years, GTA is planned to take place in **Spring 2026** as an asynchronous, self-paced learning event ​👩🏽‍💻​ open to participants all around the world 🌐​.  We hope to make this edition even more engaging and to build on the valuable feedback we received from last year's event.

To make this possible, **we need your help**!
Would you like to join the planning committee for GTA 2026? Do you want to help shape and organize the event together with us?

Based on your availability, we will set up regular organizing meetings at times that best fit the time zones of all organizers. In addition, we will use a Matrix chat for quick and asynchronous communication.

If you would like to join us later as a trainer or helper, stay tuned - we will soon announce an open call for trainers and helpers.

👉 If you are interested in helping with the planning, please contact us at: academy@galaxyproject.org.
When you reach out, please also include your office hours and time zone so we can arrange a suitable meeting time.
