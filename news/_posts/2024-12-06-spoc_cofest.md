# First SPOC CoFest

We held our first 🖖🏾[SPOC CoFest]({% link events/2024-12-06-spoc-cofest-2024.md %}), in the great tradition of the excellent CoFests organised in the GTN that welcomed @gtn:nomadscientist and many others into the community.

We welcomed a diverse group of participants, from experienced Galaxy trainers to bioinformaticians with little to no Galaxy experience whatsoever. We also were lucky enough to be joined by a 5-strong outpost from Singapore, prompting a Pacific-time-zone kick-off session prior to our day-long event.

🎉A big thank you to all the participants for their hard work!🎉

![Chart showing: 14 new participants, 5 experienced SPOC members, 60% attendance rate, 12 PRs made, 5 tutorials tested on different servers, 2 workflows updated, 8 issues raised, 2 new tutorials WIP, 5 slide decks updated, 1 trained trainer]({% link news/images/2024-12-06-spoc-cofest_outputs.png %} "SPOC CoFest: By the numbers")
