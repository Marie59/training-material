**The Galaxy Training Network (GTN)** had the pleasure of joining the "Talking about Education Across Communities at Helmholtz" ([TEACH V](https://events.hifis.net/event/2331/)) community conference, which took place in Berlin from September 29 to October 1.

The conference aimed to bring together teaching staff, educational researchers, training coordinators, and HR developers to exchange methods, best practices, and experiences - strengthening collaboration within the Helmholtz Association and its partners.

We were delighted to participate as an external member and to **present a short pitch talk about the GTN** during the BarCamp session. It was inspiring to listen to engaging talks, take part in interactive workshops, and discuss training-related topics throughout the BarCamp sessions and networking breaks.

We would like to sincerely thank the organizers for hosting this excellent event and for giving us the opportunity to take part.
