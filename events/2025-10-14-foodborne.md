# A practical workshop for (foodborne) pathogen detection from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy

Biolytix and the Freiburg Galaxy team teamed up over the last year to develop Galaxy-based workflows for accessible and scalable detection and identification of foodborne pathogens, thanks to an EOSC-Life internal grant for academia-industry collaborations.

To share about the workflows and (foodborne) pathogen detection in general, we organize a 1-day F2F at FHNW Muttenz, Switzerland , free and practical workshop on October 14th, 2025 to learn how to detect (foodborne) pathogens from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy, an open-source platform for FAIR data analysis.

## Topics

- Galaxy Introduction
- Sequence-analysis
- Foodborne

## Requirements:
- Knowledge about sequencing techniques
- Knowledge about pathogens


## Learning Outcome

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
- Name bioinformatics tools and steps required to
    - Preprocess pathogen sequencing data
    - Identify pathogens in sequencing data
    - Track pathogen contamination sources using different sequencing data
- Repeat steps in Galaxy to preprocess, identify and track pathogens from sequencing data


## Schedule

Please see the Program tab.

## Registration


The number of places in this workshop is limited. 



If you want to register, please contact Diana Hormisch ([diana.hormisch@biolytix.ch](mailto:diana.hormisch@biolytix.ch)) or Anna Henger ([anna.henger@biolytix.ch](mailto:anna.henger@biolytix.ch))


## Getting to FHNW Muttenz

### Using Public transport

The FHNW Muttenz Campus is well served by public transport.

- From Muttenz railway station: A six-minute or so walk via Hofackerstrasse or Grenzacherstrasse and through the campus park.
- By bus: Bus 46 (from/to Kleinhüngingen) or 47 (from/to Bottmingen) to the "Fachhochschule" stop, then a two-minute walk
- From the 'Zum Park' tram stop in Muttenz: Tram 14 from Basel and Pratteln, then a 10-minute or so walk via Zwinglistrasse and Kriegackerstrasse
- By train: 5 minutes by train from Basel (S3 direction Olten or S1 direction Frick) and a 5 minute walk from the train station to the campus (see above)


### By road

- Car/motorcycle
    - At the Hagnau junction on the A2 motorway take the A18 towards Delémont then leave by the Muttenz-Nord exit. At the 'Pantheon' turn left into Hofackerstrasse.
    - 232 parking spaces are available on Hofackerstrasse (the car park is located on the right-hand side just before the campus). Payment can be made using the FH Card or cash.
    - Parking spaces on the south side of the campus are available for persons with a mobility impairment.
    - More than 50 covered motorcycle parking spaces are available on the west side of the campus (ramp to basement 1)
- Bicycles: More than 500 covered and uncovered cycle parking spaces are available along Hofackerstrasse and in front of the PTC (Process Technology Centre).
