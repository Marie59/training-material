title: Machine Learning
description: This module will introduce you to the world of machine learning using Galaxy. Start with the tutorial at your own pace. If you need support contact us via the Slack Channel [gta_machine-learning](https://gtnsmrgsbord.slack.com/channels/{{page.slack_channel}}). ðŸš¨ **Unfortunately, the French Galaxy server is not supporting the Galaxy machine learning tools at the moment. Please choose one of the other Galaxy instances (US, EU, AU) to follow this training. The tutorial 'Fine tune large protein model (ProtTrans) using HuggingFace' currently works on the Galaxy EU server and the tutorial 'Building the LORIS LLR6 PanCancer Model Using PyCaret' currently works only on the US Galaxy server**.
