# Description of your event
title: Galaxy Ecology training and collabroation fest
description: |
  As colleagues from CCAMLR / Antarctica conservation from Belgium are coming to Concarneau marine station to work on Galaxy Ecology use in their projects, we propose to create an open event, where colleagues from CCAMLR / Antarctica conservation from UK, New Zealand and others are interested to participate remotely, so people wanted to learn how to use and contribute to Galaxy Ecology European Platform during these 3 days.

cost: free #
audience: This event is intended for any scientist interesting in ecology data analysis and notably biodiversity indicator production. Regarding remote participation can be complicated, maybe only some part of the event will be open to remote participation (as a minimum the tuesday morning and beginning of afternoon).

Since 2023, Galaxy Ecology initiative was joined by french Museum of Natural History (MNHN) and National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) colleagues working on Antarctica conservation notably through the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) organization. Thanks to 2 years developping tools, workflows and training tutorials as methodologies to facilitate scientific cooperation in such Antarctica context, we now can provides production services thanks to the European Galaxy instance and more than other, feedbacks on works done and benefits to go towards FAIRization of analytical processes to help conservtion of nature, in Antarctica but more broadly. This work is integrated as a pillar of the PNDB (Biodiversity data hub of Data Terra research infrastructure) EBV (Essential Biodiveristy Variables) operationalization pilot for GEO BON using the Galaxy platform to create EBV computational workflows (ie computational workflows allowing to create biodiversity metrics / indicators from raw datasets).
